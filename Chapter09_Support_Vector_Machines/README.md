_**Support vector machine (SVM)**_ is an approach for classification developed in the 1990s and considered on of the best "out of the box" classifiers.

It is a further extension of *maximal margin classifier* and *support vector classifier*. The difference between these 3 notions will be discussed below.

#### 9.1 Maximal Margin Classifier

##### 9.1.1 What is a HyperPlane?
In a _p_-dimensional space, a _hyperplane_ is a flat affine subspace of dimension _p_-1.
